\chapter{Introduction}
\patchcmd{\chapter}{\if@openright\cleardoublepage\else\clearpage\fi}{}{}{}
	\section{Purpose}

The specification defines the goals that should meet the project "Code mobility in Networked Embedded system". It is written by project members listed on the title page to precisely identify the goals to meet at the end of the project.

	\section{Scope}

	\section{Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations}

	\section{Background}

	\section{References}

	\section{Overview}

\chapter{General Description}

This section of the SRS should describe the general factors that affect 'the product and its requirements.  It should be made clear that this section does not state specific requirements; it only makes those requirements easier to understand.

	\section{Product Perspective}

This subsection of the SRS puts the product into perspective with other related products or
projects.  (See the IEEE Guide to SRS for more details).

	\section{Product Functions}

This subsection of the SRS should provide a summary of the functions that the software will perform. 

	\section{User Characteristics}

This subsection of the SRS should describe those general characteristics of the eventual users of the product that will affect the specific requirements.  (See the IEEE Guide to SRS for more details).

	\section{General Constraints}

This subsection of the SRS should provide a general description of any other items that will
limit the developer’s options for designing the system. (See the IEEE Guide to SRS for a partial list of possible general constraints).

	\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

This subsection of the SRS should list each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These factors are not design constraints on the software but are, rather, any changes to them that can affect the requirements in the SRS. For example, an assumption might be that a specific operating system will be available on the hardware designated for the software product. If, in fact, the operating system is not available, the SRS would then have to change accordingly.

\chapter{Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}

\textbf{
Global Requirements:
}


\item	\textbf{Application development requirements:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The App Developer should be enabled to instantiate up to 4 agents on a single node, which are running concurrently.
\item The App Developer should be allowed to configure the execution scheduling of the agents via a prioriatization of the agents.
\item The platform should provide a simple agent programming language to the App Developer in which the agents of an application can be developed.
\item The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possibility to reproduce its code on another node or on another board.
\item The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possibility to communicate with another agent on the same board.
\item The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possibility to access the node hardware.
\item The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possibility to implement loops. 
\item The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possibility to compare variables.
\item The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possibility to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on variables.
\item The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possibility to perform delays in the execution of code.
\item The platform should allow debugging of agents executions.
\item The platform should provide means for the creation of easily installable deployment packages.
\end{enumerate}

% The platform should provide means to add new hardware device drivers (customization).?????
%The platform should provide means to extend the agent language for own purposes (customization).????
% An Agent-Language-Assembler tool should be provided which enables the transfer of the user readable agent language to the platorm execution code,
%	which should also be easiliy extendable for customization.????

\item\textbf{Application Consumers requirements:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The platform should provide means to deploy the agent software on the target boards easily.
\item A tracing mechanism should be provided in order to ease the process of fault detection and to allow valuable bug descriptions.
\end{enumerate}

%What do the Platform Developers need:

\item\textbf{Non-functional requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The platform should be open to extensions i.e adding new hardware. (Non-functional)
\item The agent language should be extendable.(Non-functional)
\item Scalability
\item Documentation 
\item A platform tracing mechanism should be provided which allows for more efficient bugfixing.
\end{enumerate}


\item\textbf{What do the Application Designers need:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A description of the platform possibilities and limitations should be provided.
\item The platform should provide means for reducing the overall complexity of a system, by allowing encapsulation of different tasks.
\item The platform should provide configurable inter agent communication facilities.
\item The platform should provide means to enable standby scenarios by allowing dynamical code reproduction.
\item The platform should provide means for strong mobility, where an agent and its execution state are transferred to a new node or board and
   the execution on the new destination is started from the memorized state.
\item A description of a platform should provide a list of all available services
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\section{MESS)}

What do the Application Testers need:
1) ?? To test control applications you need access to sensor data ?? Hence a test mode should be supported where sensor data are presented to the tester.

Functional requirements

Non-functional requirements


Specification (based on this functional and non-functional requirements)



User defines agents in a simple programming language (called "Agent").
"Agents" program is interpreted on PC to bytecode.

NES board support four platforms (nodes) for agents interactions and execution and 1 platform (node) for board-to-board communication.



Project outline

This will be the largest and most important section of the SRS.  The customer requirements will be embodied within Section 2, but this section will give the D-requirements that are used to guide the project’s software design, implementation, and testing.

Each requirement in this section should be:
•	Correct
•	Traceable (both forward and backward to prior/future artifacts)
•	Unambiguous
•	Verifiable (i.e., testable)
•	Prioritized (with respect to importance and/or stability)
•	Complete
•	Consistent
•	Uniquely identifiable (usually via numbering like 3.4.5.6)

Attention should be paid to the carefuly organize the requirements presented in this section so that they may easily accessed and understood.  Furthermore, this SRS is not the software design document, therefore one should avoid the tendency to over-constrain (and therefore design) the software project within this SRS.
