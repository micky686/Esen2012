Define requirements for the project "Code mobility in Networked Embedded system"

Who are the users?

1.) Application Developers (Tasks: Create control application in agent language, debug, test, prepare deployment packages)
2.) Application Consumers  (Tasks: Deploy control application on target system, fill valuable bug reports)
3.) Plattform Developers (Tasks: Maintenance, Extensions, Porting to another target board)
4.) Maybe: Application Designers (Tasks: Design control application)
5.) Maybe: Application Testers (Tasks: Test control application)

Global Requirements:

What do the Application Developers need:

1) The App Developer should be enabled to instantiate up to 4 agents on a single node, which are running concurrently.
2) The App Developer should be allowed to configure the execution scheduling of the agents via a prioriatization of the agents.
3) The platform should provide a simple agent programming language to the App Developer in which the agents of an application can be developed.
4) The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possibility to reproduce its code on another node or on another board.
5) The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possiblity to communicate with another agent on the same board.
6) The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possiblity to access the node hardware.
7) The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possibility to implement loops. 
8) The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possiblitty to compare variables.
9) The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possiblity to perform addition, subtraction, muliplication and division on variables.
10) The agent language should provide the App Developer with the possiblity to perform delays in the execution of code.
11) The platform should allow debugging of agents executions.
12) The platform should provide means for the creation of easiliy installable deployment packages.


13) The platform should provide means to add new hardware device drivers (customization).?????
14) The platform should provide means to extend the agent language for own purposes (customization).????
15) An Agent-Language-Assembler tool should be provided which enables the transfer of the user readable agent language to the platorm execution code,
	which should also be easiliy extendable for customization.????

What do the Application Consumers need:
//1) The platform should provide means to deploy the agent software on the target boards easily.
2) A tracing mechanism should be provided in order to ease the process of fault detection and to allow valuable bug descriptions.


What do the Platform Developers need:

(Non-functional requirements)
1) The platform should be open to extensions i.e adding new hardware. (Non-functional)
2) The agent language should be extendable.(Non-functional)
3) Scalability
4) Documentation 
4) A platform tracing mechanism should be provided which allows for more efficient bugfixing.


What do the Application Designers need:
1) A description of the platform possiblities and limitations should be provided.
2) The platform should provide means for reducing the overall complexity of a system, by allowing encapsulation of different tasks.
3) The platform should provide configurable inter agent communication facilities.
4) The platform should provide means to enable standby scenarios by allowing dynamical code reproduction.
5) The platform should provide means for strong mobility, where an agent and its execution state are transferred to a new node or board and
   the execution on the new destination is started from the memorized state.
x) A description of a platform should provide a list of all availiable services

What do the Application Testers need:
1) ?? To test control applications you need access to sensor data ?? Hence a test mode should be supported where sensor data are presented to the tester.


Functional requirements

Non-functional requirements


Specification (based on this functional and non-functional requirements)



User defines agents in a simple programming language (called "Agent").
"Agents" program is interpreted on PC to bytecode.

NES board support four platforms (nodes) for agents interactions and execution and 1 platform (node) for board-to-board communication.
